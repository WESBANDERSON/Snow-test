# Screenshots Directory

This directory contains screenshots of the ServiceNow ESC Replica application.

## How to Add Screenshots

1. Take screenshots of your application running locally or from the deployed GitHub Pages site
2. Save them with descriptive names:
   - `dashboard.png` - Main dashboard view
   - `catalog.png` - Service catalog page
   - `requests.png` - Request management page
   - `mobile.png` - Mobile responsive view
   - `approvals.png` - Approval workflow page
   - `profile.png` - User profile page

3. Optimize images for web:
   - Use PNG format for UI screenshots
   - Keep file sizes under 500KB when possible
   - Recommended dimensions: 1920x1080 for desktop, 375x812 for mobile

## Placeholder

Until you add actual screenshots, the README will reference these paths. The application will still work without the images.
